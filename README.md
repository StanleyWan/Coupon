## Data
This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Jupyter Notebook
Here is the link of the Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and probability distributions

## The Assignment
The assignment is to find out the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.  And then to generate visualizations and probability distributions using python.

## Summary of findings

### General
Generally, the acceptance rate of the coupons is 56.8%
