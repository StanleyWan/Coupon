# Coupons
Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use the visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

## Data
This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Jupyter Notebook
Here is the link of the Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and probability distributions

## The Assignment
The assignment is to find out the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.  And then to generate visualizations and probability distributions using python.

## Summary of findings

### A. General
1. the general acceptance rate of the coupons is 56.8%
2. the bar chart of the acceptance rate of the coupons

### B. Bar Coupon Specific

1. Overall Bar Coupon Acceptance Rate: 41%
2a. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who go to the bar 3 or fewer times a month: 37.06%
2b. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who go to the bar greater than 3 time a month: 76.88%
3a. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who visit bars more than once a month and the age is over 25: 77.21%
3b. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who visit bar once or less a month and the age is under 25: 38.38%
4a. Acceptance Rata for drivers that visit bar >1 a month, the occupations is not farming, fishing or forestry, and passengers not a kid: 77.49%
4b. Acceptance rate for everyone else of the 4a: 37.19%
5a. Acceptance rate for driver that (visit bar >1 a month, passenger were not kid or widowed), or (visit bar >1 a month and the age <30) or (visit cheap restaruant >4 o month and income >50K):
