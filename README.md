# Coupons
Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon

## Goal
The goal of this project is to use the visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

## Data
This dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk.

## Jupyter Notebook
Here is the link of the Jupyter Notebook with visualizations and probability distributions

## The Assignment
The assignment is to find out the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.  And then to generate visualizations and probability distributions using python.

## Summary of findings

### A. General
1. the general acceptance rate of the coupons is 56.8%
2. the bar chart of the acceptance rate of the coupons

### B. Bar Coupon Specific

1. Overall Bar Coupon Acceptance Rate: 41%

2. 
    - 2a. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who go to the bar 3 or fewer times a month: 37.06%
    - 2b. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who go to the bar greater than 3 times a month: 76.88%

3. 
    - 3a. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who visit bars more than once a month and the age is over 25: 77.21%
    - 3b. Acceptance Rate for those drivers who visit bars once or less a month and the age is under 25: 38.38%

4. 
    - 4a. Acceptance Rate for drivers that visit bars >1 time a month, the occupation is not farming, fishing, or forestry, and the passenger is not a kid: 77.49%
    - 4b. Acceptance Rate for everyone else of 4a: 37.19%

5. 
    - 5a. Acceptance Rate for drivers that (visit bars >1 time a month, passengers were not kids or widowed), or (visit bars >1 time a month and the age <30), or (visit cheap restaurants >4 times a month and income >50K): [You need to add the % here if you have it.]
